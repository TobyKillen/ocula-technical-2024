# Ocula Technical 2024

## What I did
* 
  
## What I wish I done
* Cleaned up file types by splitting the network calls from the database calls into different services.
* 

## Further Improvements
* Implement a check to see if the (City / Date) Pair have been requested before so that we're not using our third-party API call costs. 
* Add a pre commit hook into the repo to execute pytests before being pushed to the remote
* Built out the docker file for it to be deployed using kubernetes or alternative solution
